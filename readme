This is just a quick project setup for testing nodemailer authentication configurations.
To run ensure you have node installed (preferably the same or a newer LTS version than that listed below).
Once done you can either run `npm install` or `npm setup` from this main directory to install the necessary packages.
With that done you will need to configure index.js to match your authentication needs.
To test your changes you can either run `node index.js` or `npm start`.



Developed using Node v22.16.0 and npm v10.9.2
